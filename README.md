# Drones

A collection of experimental drone projects exploring everything from **Raspberry Pi–powered flight control** to **3D-printed generative drone frames**.  
This repository gathers all stages of our journey—early prototypes, iterative designs, flight tests, and custom drone builds.

## 💡 Project Overview

We began by integrating **Raspberry Pi modules onto commercial drones**, experimenting with onboard processing, camera streaming, and control logic.  
From there, the project expanded into **generative 3D-printed drone frames**, designed, fabricated, assembled, and flight-tested by the team.
